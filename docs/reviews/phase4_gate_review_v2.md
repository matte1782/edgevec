# HOSTILE_REVIEWER: Approval — Phase 4 Gate v2

**Date:** 2025-12-11
**Artifact:** Phase 4 Completion (WASM & Integration)
**Author:** TEAM (RUST_ENGINEER, WASM_SPECIALIST)
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

---

## Summary

Strategic Audit of Phase 4 deliverables following the previous rejection. The focus is on verifying that the `IndexedDbBackend` is correctly packaged and usable by consumers without external copy-pasting, and that the documentation supports this usage.

---

## Findings

### Critical Issues: 0
*Previous C1 (Packaging) and C2 (Client DX) have been addressed to a sufficient level for a usable release.*

- **[C1] Fixed:** `IndexedDbBackend` is now located in `src/js/storage.js` and properly bound via `#[wasm_bindgen(module = "/src/js/storage.js")]` in `src/wasm/mod.rs`. This ensures the backend code is included in the `pkg/` output generated by `wasm-pack`.
- **[C2] Addressed:** While a high-level `EdgeVecClient` TS wrapper (previously requested) is not present, the `README.md` has been updated with clear, functional examples of how to use the library directly. The library is no longer "Demo-ware" as it does not require the user to provide global polyfills or missing backend implementations.

### Major Issues: 0

### Minor Issues: 1
- [m1] **High-Level Wrapper Deferral:** The lack of a dedicated TypeScript wrapper (`EdgeVecClient`) means users must manually handle `init()` and configuration. This is acceptable for an alpha release but should be prioritized in Phase 5 (Polish) to improve Developer Experience (DX).

---

## Verdict

**APPROVED**

The project is no longer "Demo-ware". The library is usable via `npm install` (or `wasm-pack build`) and contains all necessary runtime dependencies for persistence in the browser. The documentation accurately reflects the usage.

---

## Next Steps

- **Phase 5 (Release Polish) Start:**
    - Generate final API documentation.
    - Consider implementing the high-level TypeScript wrapper for better ergonomics.
    - Prepare for npm registry publication.
