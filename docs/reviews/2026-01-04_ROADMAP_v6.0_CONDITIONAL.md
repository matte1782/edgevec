## Major Issues (MUST FIX)

### [M1] Risk Register Missing Owner Assignment

**Location:** Lines 520-530, Risk Register table
**Criterion Violated:** HOSTILE_GATE_CHECKLIST Part 2, Risk Criteria MAJOR

**Current State:**
```markdown
| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
```

**Required:**
```markdown
| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
```

**Why This Matters:** Without assigned owners, risks may go unmonitored. Who escalates if R6 (Community Burnout) triggers?

**Fix:** Add Owner column with specific agent or human assignee for each risk.

---

### [M2] v0.9.0 Flat Index Has No Fallback Plan

**Location:** Lines 188-211, Milestone 9.1
**Criterion Violated:** HOSTILE_GATE_CHECKLIST Part 2, Risk Criteria CRITICAL

**Current State:**
```markdown
**Status:** AWAITING RFC from @jsonMartin
```

**Problem:** If @jsonMartin doesn't submit RFC by Week 36, v0.9.0 is blocked with no alternative path.

**Required:** Add fallback plan, such as:
1. Internal RFC if external not received by Week 34
2. Deprioritize Flat Index to v0.10.0 if RFC delayed
3. Proceed with Sparse Vectors only for v0.9.0

**Why This Matters:** External dependencies without fallback are schedule risk.

---

## Minor Issues (SHOULD FIX)

### [m1] Missing Explicit Contingency Buffer

**Location:** Phases 8-11
**Note:** Hours stated but 30% buffer not visible. Recommend adding explicit buffer row to each phase summary.

### [m2] Verification Strategy Not Per-Task

**Location:** All milestone tables
**Note:** Success metrics exist but verification method (unit/prop/fuzz/bench) implicit. Consider adding "Verification" column.

### [m3] Inter-Version Dependencies Implicit

**Location:** Version Summary (Lines 29-35)
**Note:** Add explicit dependency arrows or statement: "v0.9.0 requires v0.8.0 release."

---

## Positive Observations

1. **Community Integration:** Excellent tracking of @jsonMartin, Lucas, and other community feedback
2. **Industry Awareness:** WebGPU, WASM 3.0, Product Quantization research well-integrated
3. **Competitive Analysis:** Clear positioning vs EntityDB, Web Vector Storage, voy
4. **Phased Approach:** Research → Conditional → Implementation pattern is prudent
5. **Measurable Metrics:** All versions have quantitative success criteria

## Required Actions

1. **[M1]** Add "Owner" column to Risk Register with assignments
2. **[M2]** Add fallback plan for Flat Index if RFC delayed

---

## Next Steps After Fixes

1. Apply fixes to `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md`
2. HOSTILE_REVIEWER will verify fixes
3. Gate file `.claude/GATE_W32_PLANNING_APPROVED.md` created
4. Proceed to v0.8.0 weekly planning
