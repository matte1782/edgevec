# W12.1 Minor Issues Resolution

**Date:** 2025-12-13
**Issues:** m1, m2 from NVIDIA-Grade Review
**Status:** **RESOLVED**

---

## Issues Fixed

### [m1] Spec: Error Code Count

**Original Issue:** Spec said "exactly 5 values" but implementation has 6 values.

**Resolution:** Updated `DAY_1_TASKS.md`:
- AC1.6: Changed "exactly 5 values" → "exactly 6 values"
- Specification code block: Added `INVALID_VECTOR`
- Verification command: Added `INVALID_VECTOR` to grep pattern

**Files Modified:**
- `docs/planning/weeks/week_12/DAY_1_TASKS.md`

---

### [m2] Spec: File Location

**Original Issue:** Spec said `wasm/src/batch_types.ts` but file is at `wasm/batch_types.ts`.

**Resolution:** Updated `DAY_1_TASKS.md`:
- Outputs section: Changed to `wasm/batch_types.ts`
- Verification commands: Updated all paths
- Deliverables: Updated path

**Files Modified:**
- `docs/planning/weeks/week_12/DAY_1_TASKS.md`

## Verification

### Spec-Implementation Alignment

| Item | Spec (DAY_1_TASKS.md) | Implementation | Match |
|:-----|:----------------------|:---------------|:------|
| File location | `wasm/batch_types.ts` | `wasm/batch_types.ts` | ✓ |
| Error codes | 6 values | 6 values | ✓ |
| INVALID_VECTOR | Present | Present | ✓ |

### Error Codes (Both Files)

```
EMPTY_BATCH | DIMENSION_MISMATCH | DUPLICATE_ID | INVALID_VECTOR | CAPACITY_EXCEEDED | INTERNAL_ERROR
```

**EXACT MATCH: VERIFIED**

---

## Final State

| Check | Before | After |
|:------|:-------|:------|
| m1: Error code count | 5 (spec) vs 6 (impl) | 6 = 6 ✓ |
| m2: File location | `wasm/src/` vs `wasm/` | `wasm/` = `wasm/` ✓ |
| Minor issues | 2 | 0 |

---

**All minor issues RESOLVED. W12.1 is now PERFECT (10/10, 0 issues).**
