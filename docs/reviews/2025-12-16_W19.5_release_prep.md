## FINDINGS

### Critical Issues (BLOCKING v0.4.0 RELEASE)

**[C1] Cargo.toml version still shows v0.3.0**

```
Location: Cargo.toml line 15
Evidence: version = "0.3.0"
Expected: version = "0.4.0"
```

The version has not been bumped. Publishing with mismatched CHANGELOG would be misleading.

**[C2] Clippy warnings present (12 warnings)**

```
Location: src/wasm/mod.rs, src/persistence/snapshot.rs
Evidence: cargo clippy -- -D warnings fails with 12 errors
Types:
  - 5x casting usize to u32 truncation warnings
  - 7x missing #[must_use] attribute warnings
```

Per release checklist item: "No clippy warnings: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`"

**[C3] README.md not updated for v0.4.0**

```
Location: README.md lines 14, 349, 407
Evidence: Still references "What's New in v0.3.0", "edgevec@0.3.0"
Expected: Updated to v0.4.0
```

### Major Issues (MUST FIX BEFORE RELEASE)

**[M1] pkg/package.json version not updated**

Release checklist requires updating npm package version to 0.4.0.
Current state: Unknown (not verified in W19.5 scope).

**[M2] WASM build not verified**

Release checklist requires `wasm-pack build --release --target web` to succeed.
Not executed as part of W19.5 verification.

### Minor Issues (SHOULD FIX)

**[m1] CHANGELOG v0.4.0 date is future date (2025-12-20)**

```
Location: CHANGELOG.md line 17
Evidence: ## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-20
Issue: Today is 2025-12-16. Using future date is unconventional.
```

Should either:
- Change to today's date if releasing today
- Keep if releasing on Dec 20

**[m2] Release checklist refers to "57 items" but CHANGELOG says "25+ items"**

```
Location: CHANGELOG.md line 98, docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST_v0.4.md line 192
Evidence: Inconsistent counts
```

Not blocking but should be consistent.

## RELEASE TIMING ANALYSIS

### Should v0.4.0 be published now or wait until Week 20?

**RECOMMENDATION: WAIT UNTIL WEEK 20**

**Reasons to wait:**

1. **Critical blockers exist:**
   - Version not bumped in Cargo.toml
   - 12 clippy warnings violate release checklist
   - README.md not updated

2. **Missing verification:**
   - WASM build not tested
   - npm package.json not updated
   - Browser testing not completed

3. **Risk mitigation:**
   - Week 19 focused on documentation; code quality was not the focus
   - Better to fix clippy warnings systematically than rush
   - More time allows for edge case discovery

4. **Process adherence:**
   - Release checklist has 57 items to verify
   - Proper release should follow the checklist completely
   - Publishing prematurely undermines the checklist's purpose

**Suggested Week 20 Schedule:**

| Day | Task |
|:----|:-----|
| W20.1 | Fix clippy warnings, bump versions |
| W20.2 | Update README, run WASM build, browser test |
| W20.3 | Execute release checklist completely |
| W20.4 | Publish to crates.io and npm |
| W20.5 | Post-release verification, announcement |
