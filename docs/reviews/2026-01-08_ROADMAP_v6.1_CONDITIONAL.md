## Attack Vectors Executed

### Dependency Attack
- [x] Dependencies specific and verifiable
- [x] No circular dependencies
- [x] External dependencies have timeouts
- [x] Dependency gates defined

**Finding:** PASS. v6.1 introduces explicit dependency gates:
- Sparse Vectors → RRF (GATE: Sparse tests must pass)
- @jsonMartin RFC → Flat Index (GATE: Week 35 EOD cutoff)

### Estimation Attack
- [x] 3x rule mentioned
- [x] Tasks decomposed to < 16h
- [x] Contingency buffer included

**Finding:** PASS. Week 36 uses 12h with Day 7 buffer.

### Acceptance Attack
- [x] Every task has binary pass/fail criteria
- [x] Exit criteria defined for milestones

**Finding:** PASS. All days have explicit acceptance criteria checkboxes.

### Risk Attack
- [x] Risks identified
- [x] Mitigations documented
- [x] Fallback plans exist

**Finding:** PASS. Risk table included with MEDIUM/LOW ratings and mitigations.

## Findings

### Critical (BLOCKING)
None.

### Major (MUST FIX) — FIXED INLINE

- [M1] **Phase 8 milestone statuses inconsistent**
  - Location: ROADMAP.md lines ~770-830
  - Issue: v0.8.0 milestones showed "Status: PLANNED" but v0.8.0 was released
  - **FIX APPLIED:** Updated all 4 milestones to "Status: COMPLETE ✓"
  - **FIX APPLIED:** Marked v0.8.0 Release Checklist items as done

- [M2] **Header version mismatch**
  - Location: ROADMAP.md line 1
  - Issue: Title said "Roadmap v6.0" but content was v6.1
  - **FIX APPLIED:** Changed to "# EdgeVec Roadmap v6.1"

### Minor (SHOULD FIX)

- [m1] **Week 36 missing W[N].[X] task IDs**
  - Location: WEEKLY_TASK_PLAN.md
  - Issue: Tasks use 1.1, 1.2 format instead of W36.1.1
  - Impact: Low — internal numbering is clear
  - Action: DEFER — Can add in future weeks

- [m2] **Contingency percentage not explicit**
  - Location: Week 36 plan
  - Issue: Day 7 buffer exists but 30% contingency not calculated
  - Impact: Low — Day 7 covers ~17% (1/6), acceptable
  - Action: DEFER — Acceptable for documentation-focused week

## ROADMAP v6.1 Improvements Over v6.0

| Aspect | v6.0 | v6.1 |
|:-------|:-----|:-----|
| External dependency | @jsonMartin on critical path | Moved to conditional |
| PQ Research | In v0.9.0 with no exit criteria | Moved to v0.10.0 with criteria |
| Sparse Vectors | Blocked by RRF | First milestone (no deps) |
| Dependency gates | Implicit | Explicit with dates |
| v0.8.0 status | PLANNED | COMPLETE |

---

## Week 36 Quality Assessment

| Criterion | Status |
|:----------|:-------|
| Addresses v0.8.0 doc debt | ✅ Yes (Vue, React, Filters guides) |
| No feature work until docs done | ✅ Yes (Day 4-5 after Day 1-3) |
| Sparse RFC before implementation | ✅ Yes |
| Hostile review scheduled | ✅ Yes (Day 5, Day 7) |
| Buffer for spillover | ✅ Yes (Day 7) |
