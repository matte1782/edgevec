**Contributor:** @jsonMartin
**PR Title:** feat(simd): add WASM SIMD128 Hamming distance
**Merged:** 2025-12-26

**What was added:**
- WASM SIMD128 Hamming distance implementation (`src/metric/simd.rs:340-410`)
- AVX2 native Hamming distance implementation (`src/metric/simd.rs:1000-1055`)
- LUT-based popcount optimized for 8.75x speedup
- 10 new comprehensive tests (edge cases, boundary sizes, scalar comparison)
- Interactive benchmark page demonstrating performance

**Impact on v0.7.0:**
- **MUST** be credited in CHANGELOG
- **MUST** be highlighted in release announcement (first community contribution!)
- Performance claims updated: Hamming distance 8.75x faster

### Test Status
- **677 tests passing** (including 10 new Hamming tests)
- Clippy clean (all warnings resolved)
- SIMD builds verified
