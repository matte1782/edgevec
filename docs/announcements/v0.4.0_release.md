## Platform-Specific Announcements

### 1. Reddit r/rust

**Title:** `EdgeVec v0.4.0: High-performance vector search for Browser, Node, and Edge - now with comprehensive documentation`

**Post:**

I've been working on EdgeVec, an embedded vector database in Rust with first-class WASM support. After focusing on core functionality in previous releases, v0.4.0 is a documentation and quality sprint to make the library production-ready.

**What is EdgeVec?**

EdgeVec lets you run sub-millisecond vector search directly in browsers, Node.js, and edge devices. It's built on HNSW indexing with optional SQ8 quantization for 3.6x memory compression.

**v0.4.0 Highlights:**

- **Complete documentation suite**: Tutorial, performance tuning guide, troubleshooting (top 10 errors), integration guide (transformers.js, TensorFlow.js, OpenAI)
- **Migration guides**: From hnswlib, FAISS, and Pinecone
- **Interactive benchmark dashboard**: Compare EdgeVec vs hnswlib-node vs voy in real-time
- **Quality infrastructure**: 15 chaos tests, load tests (100k vectors), P99 latency tracking, CI regression detection

**Performance (unchanged from v0.3.0):**

- Search: 329µs at 100k vectors (768d, SQ8) - 3x under 1ms target
- Memory: 832 MB for 1M vectors (17% under 1GB target)
- Bundle: 213 KB gzipped (57% under 500KB target)

**Links:**

- GitHub: https://github.com/matte1782/edgevec
- crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/edgevec
- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/edgevec
- Interactive demo: `/wasm/examples/index.html`

**Quick Start:**

```rust
use edgevec::{HnswConfig, HnswIndex, VectorStorage};

let config = HnswConfig::new(128);
let mut storage = VectorStorage::new(&config, None);
let mut index = HnswIndex::new(config, &storage)?;

let id = index.insert(&vec![1.0; 128], &mut storage)?;
let results = index.search(&vec![1.0; 128], 10, &storage)?;
```

Looking for feedback on the documentation and any edge cases I should add to the chaos test suite. Happy to answer questions about the HNSW implementation or WASM integration.

### 2. Hacker News (Show HN)

**Title:** `Show HN: EdgeVec v0.4.0 – Sub-millisecond vector search in WASM (Rust)`

**Post:**

EdgeVec is an embedded vector database I built in Rust that runs natively in browsers via WebAssembly. v0.4.0 focuses on documentation and quality.

Key points:

- HNSW indexing with O(log n) search
- SQ8 quantization (3.6x memory reduction)
- 329µs search latency at 100k vectors
- 213 KB gzipped bundle
- 24x faster than voy (fastest pure-WASM competitor)
- Works in browsers, Node.js, and edge devices

New in v0.4.0:
- Complete docs: tutorial, tuning guide, troubleshooting
- Migration from hnswlib/FAISS/Pinecone
- Interactive benchmark dashboard
- Chaos testing (15 edge cases)
- P99 latency tracking in CI

GitHub: https://github.com/matte1782/edgevec

The use case is offline-first AI applications where you want vector search without network latency or sending embeddings to a cloud service.

- Offline-first AI apps
- Works in browsers, Node, edge devices

**Tweet 4/5:**
Performance vs competitors:

EdgeVec: 0.20ms search (WASM)
voy: 4.78ms search (WASM)
hnswlib-node: 0.05ms (native C++)

24x faster than fastest pure-WASM alternative.

**Tweet 5/5:**
Try it:

npm install edgevec

**Title:** EdgeVec v0.4.0: Production-Ready Vector Search for Browser and Edge

**Post:**

I'm excited to announce EdgeVec v0.4.0, a documentation and quality sprint for our embedded vector database.

**What is EdgeVec?**

EdgeVec is a high-performance vector search library built in Rust with first-class WebAssembly support. It enables sub-millisecond nearest neighbor search directly in browsers, Node.js, and edge devices—no cloud services required.

**Why it matters:**

As AI applications move toward edge computing and privacy-preserving architectures, the ability to run vector search locally becomes critical. EdgeVec delivers:

- 329µs search latency at 100k vectors
- 3.6x memory compression via scalar quantization
- 213 KB gzipped bundle size
- Zero network latency and complete data privacy

**What's new in v0.4.0:**

1. **Comprehensive documentation**: Tutorial, performance tuning, troubleshooting, integration guides
2. **Migration guides**: Step-by-step migration from hnswlib, FAISS, and Pinecone
3. **Quality infrastructure**: 15 chaos tests, P99 latency tracking, CI regression detection
4. **Interactive benchmark dashboard**: Real-time performance comparison

**Use cases:**

- Offline-first semantic search
- Privacy-preserving RAG applications
- Browser-based AI assistants
- Edge ML inference pipelines

The project is open source under MIT/Apache-2.0 dual license.

GitHub: https://github.com/matte1782/edgevec

I'd love to hear from anyone working on edge AI or browser-based ML applications.

### What to avoid:

1. Don't oversell - be honest about limitations
2. Don't claim "best" without data - use specific benchmarks
3. Don't compare unfairly to cloud services (different use case)
4. Don't spam multiple subreddits with the same post

### Tone:

- Humble: "I built this" not "we revolutionized"
- Technical: Include specific numbers and code
- Helpful: Offer to answer questions
- Honest: Acknowledge limitations

## Notes on Similar Projects

From research, [Victor](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37498854) is another browser-optimized vector database in Rust. Key differentiators for EdgeVec:

1. **SQ8 quantization** (Victor uses 1 byte per dimension, EdgeVec uses configurable quantization)
2. **Soft delete + compaction** (v0.3.0 feature)
3. **Comprehensive documentation suite** (v0.4.0)
4. **P99 latency tracking** (CI integration)

Be prepared to answer comparisons with Victor, hnswlib-wasm, and voy.
