Bug Description
When using edgevec v0.4.0 from npm in a Vite project, the build fails because the snippets directory is not included in the npm package.

Error Message
Could not resolve "./snippets/edgevec-e9d90602e6bb6c2c/src/js/storage.js"
Root Cause
The pkg/package.json files array doesn't include the snippets directory:

"files": [
  "edgevec_bg.wasm",
  "edgevec.js",
  "edgevec.d.ts",
  "LICENSE-APACHE",
  "LICENSE-MIT"
]
However, the package references it in sideEffects:

"sideEffects": ["./snippets/*"]
And the WASM bundle imports from ./snippets/edgevec-HASH/src/js/storage.js.

Reproduction
Create a new Vite + React project
Install edgevec: npm install edgevec
Import and use EdgeVec
Run vite build
Build fails with the above error
Suggested Fix
Add "snippets" to the files array in pkg/package.json:

"files": [
  "edgevec_bg.wasm",
  "edgevec.js",
  "edgevec.d.ts",
  "snippets",
  "LICENSE-APACHE",
  "LICENSE-MIT"
]
Workaround
As a temporary workaround, I'm using a postinstall script that creates the missing file:

// scripts/postinstall.js
import { mkdir, writeFile } from 'fs/promises'

const snippetsDir = 'node_modules/edgevec/snippets/edgevec-e9d90602e6bb6c2c/src/js'
await mkdir(snippetsDir, { recursive: true })
await writeFile(`${snippetsDir}/storage.js`, `// content from src/js/storage.js`)
Environment
edgevec: 0.4.0
Vite: 7.x
Node: 22.x
OS: Linux
Notes
I noticed that the GitHub main branch has the pkg/snippets directory with the correct storage.js file, but since it's not in the files array, it won't be published to npm.
