## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

- **Quick Hotfix Response:** v0.2.0-alpha.1 → v0.2.0-alpha.2 in 10 minutes demonstrated incident response capability
- **Documentation Quality:** Post-mortem and release checklist were created proactively
- **GitHub Release:** Clear release notes with performance tables

### What Could Be Improved

- **Pre-Release Validation:** Missing snippets/ directory showed need for package content verification (now in checklist)
- **Social Media Timing:** Consider coordinating announcements for maximum reach

### Recommendations for v0.3.0

1. Use `.claude/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` religiously
2. Test npm pack in clean environment BEFORE publish
3. Consider creating demo/playground for visual engagement
4. Schedule announcements during peak hours (varies by platform)
